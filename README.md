# Iris_Dataset_ML
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Analysis can be done on this dataset using machine learning algorithms.
This is my first Machine Learning project.
Libraries/Modules from Python that have been used in this project are LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, seaborn, sklearn, CrossValidation, train_test_split, matplotlib, numpy, pandas.
This project can be used for making predictions, graphs, analytics and learning.
